Put friend-search into a sub-component: determine if friend bar and group bar can share into


Friend 	-> Add First Friend -> Add Friends 													// Not key, making a first group is key.
		-> Add Friends
		-> Max Friends

Group	-> Create First Group |	->	Friend		...
		-> Create New Group   |					+	-> Max Group Members
																			*	-> Premium
								-> Max Groups
												*	-> Premium

Selected Group	->	Create Another Group
								-> Max Groups
												*	-> Premium
				->	Add Another friend		->	Existing
											->	New
				->	Add friend (on the side)

				->	Select Transaction

				->	Add Transaction

				->	Add first friend 															// User deleted all his friends
				

Selected User	->	Profile		-> Change Name
								-> Change Profile pic



Selected Friend	->	Delete Friend




Selected Group Extra	->	Send Breakdown
